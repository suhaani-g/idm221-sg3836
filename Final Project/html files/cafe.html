        <h3>CC’s Cafe - created using Figma</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to CC’s Cafe, a café app that brings the delightful world of 
            coffee shops and bistros right to your fingertips. As a passionate designer 
            and coffee enthusiast, I created this project to delve into the world of Figma. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This app shows the simplicity of a local coffee shop as you browse through the
            menu of drinks and sweet treats. I wanted to bring the feeling of comfort while 
            designing this app as coffee shops have always been a welcoming and warm atmosphere 
            for a college student like me.
