“Welcome to CC’s Cafe, a café app that brings the delightful world of coffee shops and bistros right to your fingertips. As a passionate designer and coffee enthusiast, I created this project to delve into the world of Figma.”

“This app shows the simplicity of a local coffee shop as you browse through the menu of drinks and sweet treats. I wanted to bring the feeling of comfort while designing this app as coffee shops have always been a welcoming and warm atmosphere for a college student like me.” 


**"Modern Minimalist Bedroom - created using Autodesk Maya"**

"This ambient bedroom located in the peaceful wilderness was inspired by a combination of aspects that I would enjoy having in my ideal space. This project was one of my very first attempts to create a 3D rendering.
